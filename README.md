# Vonage Video Remote Patient Monitoring Demo App

Remote Patient monitoring enables a nurse to monitor multiple patients' conditions remotely, and start 1-1 video call with a patient when needed.

The app has following roles:
- A Nurse can:
  - View up to 10 patients(configurable) at a time
  - Start a 1-1 call with a patient
  - Accept/Reject a patientâ€™s call request
  - View the rest of the patients even in a call

- Patients can:
  - Join a 1-1 call that initiated by a nurse
  - Request to call a nurse


Max patients per Page:
A nurse can monitor up to 10 patients(configurable) at a time in a monitoring session, and 3 patients at a time while in a call.

When you first launch the app, you will be asked to enter a room name. Ensure both nurse and patients have the same room name so they can join the same session.


## Environment Variables
You need to setup some environment variables 

  - `PORT` -- this variable works only for manual deployment. Heroku deployment will automatically fill the value.
  - `VIDEO_API_API_KEY` -- your Vonage Video API - API Key
  - `VIDEO_API_API_SECRET` -- your Vonage Video API - API Secret
  - `REACT_APP_MAX_PATIENTS_PER_PAGE` -- maximum number of patients in a page

## Manual Deployment
This section is for manual deployment. It means you need to have a 
  
  - Linux machine with `SSH`. Make sure you can `SSH` to your machine.
  - `NodeJS` installed
  - `yarn` or `npm` installed

Once you satisfy the requirements, you can proceed to below steps.
  
  - Clone and navigate inside this repository.
  - Go to frontend folder `cd frontend`
  - Install dependencies by typing `yarn install` if you are using `yarn` or `npm install` if you are using `npm`
  - Build the package by typing `yarn build` if you are using `yarn` or `npm run build` if you are using `npm`
  - Go to root folder `cd ..`
  - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the environment variable.
  - Install dependencies by typing `yarn install` if you are using `yarn` or `npm install` if you are using `npm`
  - Start the server `yarn start` or `npm run start`
  - Open your web browser. For example `http://localhost:3002`

The local deployment has been done. You can use various technology such as `ngrok` or `nginx` to make it public. Furthermore, for this demo to run smoothly in public, you need `https` or `SSL`. 

`ngrok` will automatically grant you `SSL` certificate. However, if `nginx` was choose as public deployment, you can use `Let's Encrypt` to get your free `SSL` certificate.
